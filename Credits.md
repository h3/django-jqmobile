# django-mobileadmin #

Thanks to Jannis Leidel who released django-mobileadmin under open source license. Django-mobileadmin was helpful in many ways to jumpstart the jqmobile project.

The key difference between mobileadmin and jqmobile is how each projects deals with mobile device detection. With mobileadmin the detection occurs server side and custom templates can be created for each mobile device whereas jqmobile use the same templates for all devices and let [jQuery mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) deal with the discrepancies between each of them.

With this in mind you should chose the project that better fits your needs.
